# Space_Invader Game

Space_Invader is an exciting Python game where players are tasked with defending their territory by shooting down enemy aircraft before they invade. This project brings the classic Space Invaders concept to life, leveraging the PyGame library and employing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.
